# Instead

Instead is a privacy-focused photo sharing service.

* **Private:** accounts are always private, and all followers need to be approved. 
* **Encrypted:** every photo posted to Instead is encrypted, with decryption keys only provided to followers. This means nobody else–not even the owner of the server–can see posts.
* **No ads or tracking:** Instead does only what it needs to in order to let you share photos.
